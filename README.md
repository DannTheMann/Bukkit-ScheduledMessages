# Bukkit-ScheduledMessages
Would schedule messages to appear, messages could be collectively created in paragraphs too. Could make some messages disappear after a specified time, such as server notices on discounts or the alike.

Was quite a funky plugin for handling messages.

You could display messages like this...

BORDER
" LINE 1 "
" LINE 2 "
" LINE 3 "
" LINE 4 "
BORDER

So it would appear something like...

Could also make specific messages and then tell them to be deleted after x amount of time.

So a message talking about recent events or something, like "Happy Christmas!" or "20% Discount for this week only!"

That sorta thing.
